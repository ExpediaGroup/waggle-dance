* Waggle Dance updated to use Spring-Boot-2.0.4 instead of Spring Platform BOM. See [#105](https://github.com/HotelsDotCom/waggle-dance/issues/105).
* Changed JVM Metrics, the following modifications are needed if you are tracking these metrics and want to achieve equivalency:
    * `memory.heap.used` -> `sum(jvm.memory.used.area.heap.id.*)` - i.e. you now need to sum up all the heap spaces
    * `memory.heap.max` -> `sum(jvm.memory.max.area.heap.id.*)` - i.e. you now need to sum up all the max used heap spaces
    * `threads.*` -> `jvm.threads.*`
