### Glue support

In order to support federation to AWS Glue catalog these two jars are added as libraries which have to be installed manually like so:
```
project_dir>lib/install_local_libs.sh
```

The source of these can be found here: https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/aws-glue-data-catalog-client-for-apache-hive-metastore
